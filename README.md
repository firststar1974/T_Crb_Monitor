# T CrB Global Monitoring Project

The T CrB Global Monitoring Project aims to conduct high time-resolution (minute-level) observations of the recurrent nova T CrB by leveraging a global network of amateur and professional astronomers. This project emphasizes real-time data processing, collaborative observations, and efficient data sharing to study transient astronomical phenomena.

---

## Overview

The project is comprised of two main Python scripts:

- **Client Script (`T_CrB_client-E_github.py`)**
  - **Purpose:**  
    Continuously monitors a specified directory for new observational FITS files, processes these images using automated photometry routines, and sends the extracted photometric data to a central server.
  - **Key Features:**  
    - Automated image alignment and photometric analysis using libraries such as `astroalign` and `SEP`.
    - Real-time scheduling to periodically scan directories and process new files.
    - Integration with a configuration file (`cfg.txt`) to define observation settings, including station identifiers, filter types, and target coordinates.
    - Data transmission via TCP to the server.

- **Server Script (`T_server_github.py`)**
  - **Purpose:**  
    Receives observational data from client systems, parses and aggregates the photometric measurements, updates records in Excel files, and generates visualizations (such as light curves and median magnitude trends).
  - **Key Features:**  
    - Acts as a TCP server to listen for incoming data from multiple client systems.
    - Processes and organizes the received data for real-time monitoring and historical record-keeping.
    - Generates plots for various time spans and triggers alerts when significant brightness changes are detected.
    - Implements a backup system to archive snapshot images and maintain historical data files.

## Prerequisites

Before running the scripts, please ensure the following:

- **Python Environment:**  
  Python 3.6 or later is required.
  
- **Operating System:**  
  The client script is designed for Windows (due to dependencies on Windows-based observational software and file path conventions). The server script is platform-independent as long as the required Python packages are supported.

- **Required Libraries:**  
  The scripts rely on standard scientific libraries (such as NumPy, Astropy, Pandas, and Matplotlib) and specialized packages like `astroalign`, `SEP`, and `schedule`. Make sure these are installed in your Python environment.

- **Configuration File:**  
  A configuration file (`cfg.txt`) should be placed in the same directory as the client script. This file contains important settings (e.g., station ID, filter information, target coordinates) necessary for data processing.

## How It Works

1. **Data Acquisition and Processing (Client Side):**  
   - Observers store FITS images in a monitored directory.
   - The client script automatically detects new files, aligns the images using template files, and performs photometry to extract brightness data.
   - Processed photometric data is formatted and sent to the server via a TCP connection.

2. **Data Aggregation and Visualization (Server Side):**  
   - The server script listens for incoming data from clients.
   - Received data is parsed, aggregated, and stored in Excel files for both real-time and historical analysis.
   - The script generates visualizations (e.g., light curves, median magnitude trends) to help monitor T CrBâ€™s eruption in real time.
   - An alert mechanism is in place to notify operators if significant brightness variations are detected.
   - The server also manages data backups and file rotations to preserve historical records.

3. **Collaboration and Community:**  
   - By combining data from multiple observation sites, the project overcomes spatial and temporal limitations of individual observatories.
   - This collaborative model enhances the scientific value of the observations and encourages public participation in astronomical research.

## Getting Started

To set up and run the project:

1. **Prepare your Environment:**  
   Install Python 3.6+ and all necessary libraries in your working environment.

2. **Configure the Client:**  
   Place the `cfg.txt` file in the same directory as the client script, and specify the directory where your FITS images are stored.

3. **Run the Scripts:**  
   - Start the client script on your Windows machine to begin monitoring and processing observational data.
   - Launch the server script on a designated machine to receive data, generate plots, and manage data aggregation.
